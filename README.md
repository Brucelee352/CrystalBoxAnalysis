# CrystalBoxAnalysis
A break down of my Pokémon Crystal boxes, and possibly one of the nerdiest things you'll read about Pokémon. 

## Overview
In this R-based analysis, I sourced data from a hacking tool used with Generation 2 (Gold, Silver, Crystal) Pokémon games to collect a .csv of the box data contained within my save file. 
From there, I loaded it into R Studio as a data frame, where I then cleaned everything up using dplyr calls and visualized everything I wanted to answer questions on using ggplot2. 

As a represenation of a trainer's journey, the Pokémon contained in your boxes share your highs and lows as a trainer on a path to self-discovery through the unknown. Many of the insights I gleaned from 
this have been with me since my beginnings as a Pokémon trainer, and in my 30s, I proudly share with you the fruits of a destination seldom braved.
